# oven ready

## key words: 
#### pytorch, flask, camera, heroku, transfer learning, convolutional neural network

A simple app to check if an oven is on or off. The long term intention is to see if it would be useful for partially sighted people.

A neural network is trained using pytorch and the network is presented as a Flask app.

The neural network is specific to a single oven

I have deployed the application on heroku.

The project has been developed for me to learn some new programming skills:

- using neural networks 
- Flask web server
- javascript and DOM programming
- RESTFUL web design
- css and html5
- deployment to a commercial web service, Heroku, AWS, Azure...

There are plenty of things still to do.

- improve the look of the app on tablets and phone using css
- employ speech to text so that the user can start and control the app with their voice
- improve the model to recognise when it is looking at the oven or not and then check the on off status
- improve the model to be general for more than one make of oven att a time
- allow a user to load images of their own oven in on off position so that a new model can be trained and added to the system
- add technical documentation so that others can deploy it to Heroku and train a model.
- add documentation
